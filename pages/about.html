        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a passionate web developer with a background in computer science
          and over 3 years of experience building user-friendly, accessible web
          applications. My journey started in the university where I fell in
          love with the creative problem-solving aspect of programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, I've worked with various technologies including React,
          Vue.js, and modern CSS frameworks. I believe in creating web
          experiences that are not only visually appealing but also inclusive
          and accessible to everyone.

        <p>My primary goals for this program include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Mastering advanced frontend development patterns and best practices
          </li>
          <li>
            Improving my understanding of web accessibility standards and
            implementation

          <li>
            Enhancing my skills in responsive design and cross browser
            compatibility
          </li>
          <li>Learning to build more efficient and maintainable codebases</li>
          <li>Developing expertise in performance optimization techniques</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'm particularly excited about the opportunity to work on real-world
          projects and receive feedback from experienced developers in the
          field.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          While I'm comfortable with many aspects of frontend development, there
          are areas where I'd like to build more confidence:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Advanced javascript logic:</strong> I understand the basics
            but want to master how to handle and debug it
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Web accessibility implementation:</strong> I know the
            principles but want more practice with complex ARIA patterns
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance optimization:</strong> I can identify
            performance issues but want to get better at preventing them
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Testing strategies:</strong> I want to improve my skills in
            writing comprehensive unit and integration tests
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'm looking forward to addressing these areas through hands-on
          practice from this program.

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Remember why you started this journey. The late nights debugging, the
          moments of frustration when something wouldn't work, and the
          exhilaration when it finally did all of these experiences are shaping
          you into a better developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't lose sight of the joy in creating things that solve real
          problems. Keep learning, stay curious, and don't be afraid to ask for
          help when you need it. The tech landscape will continue to evolve, and
          your ability to adapt will be your greatest strength.
        </p>

      <!-- Additional thought -->
      <section class="about-section" data-testid="test-about-extra">
        <h2>Additional Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I'm particularly passionate about the intersection of technology and
          social impact. I believe that as developers, we have a responsibility
          to create digital experiences that are inclusive, ethical, and
          beneficial to society.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, I hope to contribute to projects that address real
          world challenges like education accessibility, and healthcare
          innovation. I'm excited about the potential of technology to make
          positive changes in people's lives.
